        <div className="text-4xl">1. WHEN WAS FILM INVENTED? THE 1890S</div>
        <img src={firstMovie}></img>
        <p>
          Motion pictures date all the way back to the 1890s when the first
          moving picture cameras were invented. However, the very first moving
          picture – The Roundhay Garden Scene – was actually a product of the
          1880s. In 1888, French inventor Louis Le Prince filmed his family
          prancing around in a circle in a whopping two second clip. While that
          seems insignificant now, it’s innovation is what would eventually lead
          to commercialized cameras and motion pictures. Before the advancement
          of the Hollywood scene, movies were somewhat boring. They started out
          short and only included a single scene that was about a minute long.
          They were typically silent - except...

          2. THE EARLIEST SHORT FILMS WERE SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED BY BANDS
        </div>
        <img src={movieBand}></img>

        <p>
          What fun would it be sitting in a theatre while random, everyday
          scenes scrolled by silently on a screen? Awkward. To make up for the
          lack of sound in a film, sometimes a band would play live music while
          the movie was playing. After all, who wants to hear someone going to
          town on a bag of popcorn in a deaf theater?

          3. THE PANORAMA SHOT WAS DEVELOPED IN 1987
        </div>
        <img src={panningCamera}></img>

        <p>
          1987 is the year panning cameras were first used in film production,
          meaning the pan shot, also known as the panorama shot, was invented
          then. Before, cameras were stationary, so you had to move the entire
          camera and tripod to get any kind of movement. This was a huge
          advancement in film making and cinematography as an art form.

          4. EARLY CAMERAS FILMED AT 16 FRAMES PER SECOND (FPS)
        </div>
        <img src={oldCamera}></img>

        <p>
          {" "}
          By today’s standards, a 16 frames per second speed is pretty slow. For
          perspective, modern 35mm cameras film at 25 FPS. If you want your mind
          blown, some modern video games are played at 250 FPS. But hey, you’ve
          got to start somewhere, right?

        <div className="text-4xl">
          5. 13 FRAMES PER SECOND IS THE SLOWEST SPEED THE HUMAN BRAIN WILL
          PROCESS IMAGES CONSECUTIVELY
        </div>
        <img src={brainProcessing}></img>

        <p>
          13 FPS is the minimum speed that the human brain needs in order to
          process consecutive images as movement. Anything less than that and
          the human brain will process each frame as a separate picture. 16 FPS
          is pretty close to 13, which is why old movies look so choppy and
          unnatural.

          6. THE FIRST FEATURE-LENGTH FILM WAS PRODUCED IN 1906
        </div>
        <img src={kellyGang}></img>

        <p>
          The Australian film, The Story of the Kelly Gang, was the first
          feature length film in history. You can see the cast, box office, and
          budget details on IMDB. It was over an hour long, and the reel length
          was about 4,000 feet. To put that in perspective, a small 5-inch reel
          of film holds up to 200 ft., a 6-inch holds 300 ft. and a 7-inch 400
          ft. Depending on the size of the reel that, movie is housed in, that’s
          at least 10 reels of 7-inch film and at most 20 reels of 5-inch film.
          Imagine that! Crazy enough, it was almost lost forever, but a few
          pieces of the The Story of Kelly Gang film surfaced in 1975, which
          helped preserve some of the history-making movie.

          7. THE FIRST MOVIE THEATERS OPENED IN 1907
        </div>
        <img src={firstMovieTheatre}></img>

        <p>
          Before 1907, most movies were shown in traditional theaters or at
          carnivals. With the advent of movie theaters, the films became the
          main attraction themselves.

          8. A 1,000 FOOT LONG FILM WILL PRODUCE 11 MINUTES OF FOOTAGE AT 25 FPS
        </div>
        <img src={movieReel}></img>

        <p>
          A standard reel of film that runs at 25 FPS is 1,000 feet long. This
          1,000 feet of film will produce about 11 minutes of footage. That
          means that projectionists at movie theatres had to change reels many
          times during a single motion picture to keep it going uninterrupted.
          Unlike today, where everything is digital and automated.

          9. THE TITANIC MOVIE WAS 17.7 REELS LONG WHEN RELEASED
        </div>
        <img src={titanic}></img>

        <p>
          Titanic came out in 1997 when film reels were still the only way to
          project a movie. With a run time of 3 hours and 15 minutes, each copy
          of Titanic was 17.7 reels long. That means, at 25 FPS, it consisted of
          over 17,700 feet of film. That’s over 3 miles for a single movie. For
          reference, the Titanic was 883 feet long … that’s nearly 20 Titanic's
          long.

          10. MOVIE THEATRES NOW USE DIGITAL LIGHT PROCESSING (DLP)
        </div>
        <img src={DLP}></img>

        <p>
          Most movie theaters these days use digital video projectors. The
          technology is called DLP which stands for Digital Light Processing.
          Since modern films are projected digitally, movie studios don’t ship
          huge reels of film to the theaters anymore, which in reality is a
          giant time and money save. Now, they just send the videos via the
          internet, satellite, or hard drive. Another huge advancement in the
          film industry! The improvements in film have brought many different
          ways for individuals to capture and create their own movies and
          memories over the years. Whether you have tapes, film, photos, or
          audio recordings, Legacybox can help digitize your memories so they
          can be enjoyed by generations to come.
