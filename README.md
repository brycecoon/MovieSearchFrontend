# MovieSearch

Movie Organizer

New things I'll have to do
1. Get all movies from an api
2. Carousel and pagination for showing movies
3. Personalized calendar. 


# Pages.
1. Landing page - see random movies possibly in a carousel
2. Movie Detail Page - See details for a movie. Can add reviews to each movie specific to my website. Can maybe add notes too
3. Lists - Personalized lists of to watch, favorites, etc. CRUD for each list
4. Voting - Vote on best movies which is shared across users. This will save specifically for my website and can be shown on the landing page. 
5. Movie information page for cool facts and tidbits like from the tv show I saw
6. Filter page by rating, year, review number etc. 
7. Actor/Director page
8. Movies in theatres
9. A 'what should I watch' page to generate a random movie to try out. Maybe can generate n number of options and can still filter by genre or review number.
10. User Profile page. Can choose to upload a profile picture, bio and any other important details. 
11. Admin page, can see how many users have logged in to the site(mainly to satisfy the rubric)
12. Stretch goal - Watchlist calendar. allow users to schedule when they plan to watch movies and view in a calendar format
